# Authentication source settings
#
# The ID mapper supports multiple sources of authentication and is extensible. Implementations
# are included for local authentication and KBase (https://kbase.us) authentication.
#
# Local authentication ('local' below) is a special built-in case that requires no configuration,
# unlike other authentication sources. Local users and administrators are created using the
# ID mapping CLI.
######

# Defines which authentication sources are active. Other than local authentication, active
# authentication sources will need further configuration below to tell the service how to build
# the user lookup instance for the authentication source. If an authentication source is
# inactive, users from that source will be unable to use ID mapping service functions that
# require authentication.
authentication-enabled=local
#authentication-enabled=local, kbase

# Defines which authentication sources are trusted to determine which of their users are system
# administrators for the ID mapping service. If an authentication source is not included in this
# list, none of the users of that authentication source may administer the system.
# Thus, at least one authentication source should be admin-enabled at all times, unless
# no further changes to namespaces that require system administration privileges are desired.
authentication-admin-enabled=local
#authentication-admin-enabled=local, kbase

# The remainder of the settings are authentication source specific. The keys, per source, are:
# auth-source-<name>-factory-module=<module>
# auth-source-<name>-init-<X>=<Y>
#
# Where:
# <name> is the name of the authentication source matching that in the authentication-enabled
#     and authentication-admin-enabled keys.
# <module> is the python module for building the user lookup instance for the authentication
#     source. The module must have a module level method called build_lookup that takes
#     a Dict[str, str] of configuration parameters and returns a UserLookup instance for
#     the authsource.
# <X> and <Y> are a key-value configuration pair that will be passed, along with all the other
#     key-value pairs defined for a particular authentication source, to the build_lookup
#     factory method.
